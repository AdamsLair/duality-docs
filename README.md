# Duality Docs

This repository hosts the online documentation of the [Duality game engine](https://duality.adamslair.net/) using GitHub pages. Contributions are always welcome!

## What to contribute

Both new manual pages and improvements to existing ones are greatly appreciated. If you want to contribute, but are not yet sure what to do, check out our [issue tracker](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality-docs/issues) where we organize page requests, errors, improvements and tasks.

## How to contribute

The project is built upon the technology provided by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). In almost all cases though, it's sufficient for you to know your way around [Markdown](https://www.google.de/search?q=markdown), the markup language in which all documentation pages are written.
