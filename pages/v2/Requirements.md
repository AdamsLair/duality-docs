# End User requirements

To launch a Duality application, the end user needs the [.Net Framework 4.5](https://www.google.de/#hl=en&q=.net+framework+4.5) on Windows machines, or the equivalent [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) version on non-Windows machines. The actual hardware minimum to launch a Duality application depends on the application itself.

# Developer requirements

For developing Duality games, you're going to need a Windows machine - and since Duality doesn't bring its own programming IDE, any source code related activity will require additional software. I'd recommended to use [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/) (at least version 2013, Update 3). There is also a Community Version of Visual Studio that is completely free - you don't need any kind of professional version for Duality development.
